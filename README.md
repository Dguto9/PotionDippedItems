# PotionDippedItems
A Minecraft Spigot plugin which allows you to cover your armor and weapons with a layer of a potion of your choice! First, combine any lingering potion with a netherite ingot inside of an Anvil. Then, combine the new, "Shimmering", lingering potion with a diamond or netherite sword, or diamond or netherite chestplate/leggings! With swords, the effect will be applied to the victim of your menacing attack, and with armor, the effect will be applied to you when you get hit! This is a great way to make PVP more exciting, and add an extra layer to your tool upgrading flow.
